<p align="left"> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=trukafatsum&label=Profile%20views&color=0e75b6&style=flat" alt="trukafatsum" /> </p>

 I'm someone who has recently stepped into the world of software development. Currently, I'm learning the C# programming language along with the .NET Framework and working with MSSQL databases. 

Alongside this, I have an interest in graphic design and am cultivating my skills by creating amateur works using tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

Gaming is a passion of mine. I share my experiences in gaming content on YouTube, aiming to answer questions like "how-tos" and to demonstrate what players can achieve, even in seemingly impossible situations.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Mustafa's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a player in Silkroad Online from 2007 to 2018. After approximately 12 years of playing the game, I wanted to shift my focus from gaming to understanding its mechanics. Despite having no prior experience in software, I slowly started gaining knowledge about databases (MSSQL). I acquired fundamental insights into queries, their coding, and relationships between tables.
<br /><br />
In 2021, I enrolled in the Computer Programming department of a open education Anadolu university. Throughout this period, I endeavored to enhance my skills by consuming various content on platforms like YouTube and Udemy, focusing on subjects such as C#, .NET Framework, Design Patterns, and Architectures. I graduated after completing the two-year program in Computer Programming. I am still in the ongoing process of learning.
